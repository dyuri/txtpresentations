{{{ Time series databases
}}}

{{{ Why do we want to use one?

- optimized for handling time series data (like measurements)
- classic DBs are usually not really good at this

}}}

{{{ rrdtool

- since 1999, for storing monitoring data (Munin)
- fix database (file) size
- data can be stored in multiple precision (~retention)
- still in development
- bindings for lot of languages

}}}

{{{ whisper / Graphite

- since 2008, part of Graphite monitoring software
- very similar to rrd, but
  - can take updates prior to the most recent update (for network outages)
  - handles irregular updates much better
- easy to use API if used with Carbon (part of Graphite as well)

- alternative implementation: go-carbon

}}}

{{{ OpenTSDB

- since ~2013
- on top of Hadoop + HBase
- no retention (keep raw data forever)
- ms precision
- highly scalable, millions of writes per sec

}}}

{{{ InfluxDB / TICK

- since 2015, IoT optimized, with commercial version (and support)
- OS (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Chronograf, Kapacitor ~ Graphite) + Commercial (Clustering, Cloud, ...)
- Configurable retention, "continous queries"
- SQL like queries

}}}

{{{ Displaying time series data - Grafana

- OS w/ commercial cloud and support
- lot of widgets
- lot of available datasources (Graphite, OpenTSDB, InfluxDB; MySQL, Postgres ...)
- easy to configure and create beautyful dashboards
